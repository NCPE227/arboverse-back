                    <h1>Diagnostic, genomics and pathogenesis of arboviruses</h1>
                    <h4>Arboviral diseases are infections transmitted by the bite of infected hematophagous arthropods.
                        Arboviruses such as dengue, yellow fever, West Nile, Chikungunya and Zika disproportionately
                        affect most vulnerable populations, causing hundreds of millions of cases annually and
                        overwhelming health systems in tropical countries. Our work has been developing diagnostic
                        assays based on serological and molecular approaches, including neglected arboviruses, such as
                        Mayaro and the Oropouche virus. Since 2013, we have been characterized by the genomic diversity
                        of ~50 arbovirus species from tropical regions of the Americas. Recently, we have implemented a
                        framework based on a multi-omics approach to investigate mechanisms involved in arbovirus
                        infections, such as fatal outcomes caused by the Chikungunya virus. Finally, we collaborated
                        with experimental models of arboviruses infections, such as Mayaro, Chikungunya, and Zika.</h4>

                    <h1>Virus discovery and evolution</h1>
                    <h4>Zoonotic viruses cause two-thirds of emerging infectious diseases globally, thousands of deaths
                        annually, and a significant impact on public health and the economy. In this context, we have
                        been combined metagenomics and bioinformatics approaches to discovered and characterized novel
                        viruses (to date, over 100 ) in samples from rodents, bats, opossums, avian and ticks from South
                        America, Africa and Antarctica. This framework has been combined with classical virological
                        methods to identify the basic characteristics of these new viruses, such as frequency,
                        distributions and tropism. Besides, we have been conducting studies of the evolutionary history
                        of emerging viruses, including element viruses endogenous originated and integrated into animal
                        genomes hundreds to millions of years ago.</h4>

                    <h1>SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19</h1>
                    <h4>During the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic, we have been conducted several studies about SARS-CoV-2
                        and COVID-19 in Brazil. Based on large joint analyses of genomic and epidemiological data, we
                        reported at least 100 international virus introductions in Brazil and uncovered temporal changes
                        in the patterns of virus spread and transmission across the country. Also, we identified that
                        socioeconomic disparities dictate access to COVID-19 diagnosis and that heterogeneously
                        implemented non-pharmaceutical interventions impede epidemic control. In another study, we
                        identified that low-income and Black and Pardo communities are more likely to die with COVID-19.
                        In early 2021, we contributed to the identification of P.1 lineage that emerged in Manaus city.
                        Subsequently, we showed that P.1 lineage might escape from neutralizing antibodies elicited by
                        previous SARS-CoV-2 infection and chemically-inactivated vaccine.</h4>
